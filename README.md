# maclm-agent

`maclm-agent` is a native, fully local AI assistant for macOS. The project is
designed to work with locally hosted language models and to control the machine
through an explicit, human-approved tool layer without relying on cloud services.

Version v0.1.3 provides a streaming chat with an LM Studio server at
`http://localhost:1234/v1`. Conversations and messages are stored with
SwiftData and remain available after relaunch. The main window includes a
sidebar for creating, switching, renaming, and deleting conversations. A
compact menu bar chat shares the active conversation and streaming state with
the main window.

## Requirements

- macOS 15.0 or later on Apple Silicon
- Xcode with the macOS 15 SDK or later
- SwiftLint and SwiftFormat: `brew install swiftlint swiftformat`
- XcodeGen only when regenerating the project: `brew install xcodegen`

## Build and run

```sh
make build
make test
make lint
make run
```

You can also open `maclm-agent.xcodeproj` in Xcode, select the `maclm-agent`
scheme, and press Run. App Sandbox is intentionally disabled for this direct
distribution project.
